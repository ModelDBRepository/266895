<p>The code was run using Cx3Dp, which can be downloaded from (last checked on 7th January 2021): <a href="https://www.ini.uzh.ch/~amw/seco/cx3d/">https://www.ini.uzh.ch/~amw/seco/cx3d/</a></p>

<p>To run the simulations, a jar archive file based on the cx3dp class files was created. The source code for the layer formation simulations was placed in a folder that includes this jar file, and the layer formation simulation was run using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>
java -Xmx100G -Xms95G -cp mycx3dp.jar Lamination -Cworkers 11 -Sworkers 1 -Pmmax 600 -Globalmin 600 -Balanceround 400</code></pre>
